Module 4: Security and Access Control in ArgoCD

Lesson 4.1: Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in ArgoCD

1. RBAC Overview:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in ArgoCD:
In ArgoCD, RBAC is a security concept that controls access to resources based on roles assigned to users or service accounts. RBAC ensures that only authorized individuals or components can perform specific actions within ArgoCD.

Roles in ArgoCD:

- Admin Role: This role typically has full control over ArgoCD, including the ability to create, update, and delete applications, manage configurations, and grant/revoke access to other
  users.
- Developer Role: Developers may have restricted access compared to admins, often limited to managing applications and deploying changes but not modifying global configurations.

- Viewer Role: Viewers usually have read-only access, allowing them to observe the state of applications and configurations without making any changes.

2. Create RBAC Configuration:
Creating ' argocd-rbac.yaml:


```

apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: argocd-cluster-admin
  namespace: argocd
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: argocd-server
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io


```


Explanation:

- 'apiVersion': Specifies the API version for RBAC in Kubernetes.

- 'kind': Defines the type of resource, which is a 'RoleBinding" in this case.

- 'metadata': Contains information about the " RoleBinding", such as its name and namespace.

- 'subjects" : Identifies the entity (in this case, a ServiceAccount named 'argocd-server') to which the role is being bound.

- 'roleRef: Specifies the role being referenced, Which is 'cluster-admin' in this example.

3. Apply RBAC Configuration:

Applying the configuration:


```

kubectl apply -f argocd-rbac.yaml


```


Explanation:

- 'kubectl apply': Applies the configuration in the specified file to the Kubernetes cluster.

- '-t argocd-rbac.yaml': Specifies the file containing the RBAC configuration.

This command informs Kubernetes to create the specified 'RoleBinding' based on the configuration defined in 'argocd-rbac-yaml'.

4. Verify RBAC Configuration:
Checking the Configuration:


```

Kubectl get role binding -n argued


```

Explanation:


- 'Kubectl get rolebinding": Retrieves information about the role bindings in the specified namespace.

-  '-n argocd': Specifes the namespace ('argocd" in this case).

This command checks whether the 'argod-cluster-admin' role binding has been successfully created in the 'argod" namespace. If successful, you should see details of the role binding, confrming that RBAC has been configured.

Lesson 4.2: Securing ArgoCD with Authentication Strategies (OAuth, SSO)

1. OAuth Configuration:

OAutn Overview:


OAuth (Open Authorization) is a security framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's resources without exposing credentials. In ArgoCD, Auth can be configured to authenticate users and grant them access based on external identity
providers.

Creating 'argocd-oauth.yaml':


```

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  server:
    route:
      hosts:
        - argocd.example.com
    tls:
      insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
  dex:
    config:
      connectors:
        - type: "oidc"
          id: "oauth"
          name: "OAuth"
          config:
            issuer: "https://accounts.google.com"
            clientID: "<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID>"
            clientSecret: "<YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET>"
            redirectURI: "https://argocd.example.com/auth/callback"



```


Explanation:

- 'apiVersion': Specifies the API version for ArgoCD.

- 'kind": Defines the type of resource, which is an 'ArgoCD' custom resource.

- 'metadata': Contains information about the ArgoCD instance, such as its name.

- 'spec': Specifies the configuration for the ArgoCD instance.

- 'server': Configures the ArgoCD server settings.

- 'route': Defines the hostname for accessing ArgoCD.

- 'tls': Configures LS settings for secure communication.

- dex': Specifies the Dex configuration for identity services.

- 'connectors': Describes the identity providers, with the example using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Auth.

- 'issuer': Identifies the URL of the Auth provider (Google in this case).

- 'clientID' and 'clientSecret': Credentials obtained when registering ArgoCD with the Auth provider.

- 'redirectURI": The URI where the Â©Auth provider redirects after successful authentication.


2. Apply Auth Configuration:

Applying the Configuration:

```
kubectl apply -f argocd-oauth.yaml

```
exolanation:

- 'kubectl apply': Applies the configuration in the specified file to the Kubernetes cluster.

- '-f argocd-oauth.yaml': Specifies the file containing the Auth configuration.

This command applies the Auth configuration to your ArgoCD instance, enabling Auth-based authentication.

3. Verify OAuth Configuration:

Verifying Auth Authentication:

After applying the configuration, access the ArgoCD UI (*https://argocd.example.com*) and try logging in using Auth. If successful, it indicates that the Auth authentication is working as expected.


4. Single Sign-On (SSO) Configuration:

SSO Overview:

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows users to log in once and access multiple applications without re-authenticating. In ArgoCD, SSO can be configured to integrate with an SSO provider, enhancing user experience and security.
Configuring SSO with Preferred Provider:

Follow the ArgoCD documentation for [SSO Configuration](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/sso/) to configure ArgoCD with your preferred SSO provider.
This documentation will guide you through the steps of integrating ArgoCD with your chosen SSO provider, ensuring seamless authentication across multiple applications.
In summary, these steps help secure ArgoCD by implementing Auth for authentication and providing options for Single Sign-On integration, enhancing both security and user convenience.
Lesson 4.3: Audit Trails and Compliance Strategies in ArgoCD
Objective: Implement audit trails and compliance strategies to track changes in ArgoCD.

1. Audit Logs Connguration:
	- Go to the ArgoCD documentation for [Audit Logs Configuration](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/security/audit/).

	- Configure audit logs by updating the ArgoCD configuration:

```

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  server:
    config:
      url: https://argocd.example.com
      'logFormat': "text"


```

2. Compliance Strategies:

	- Discuss strategies for compliance, such as regular audits, version control of ArgoCD configurations, and integration with compliance tools.
	  Verification'

	- Verify that audit logs are being generated by checking the logs of the ArgoCD server pod:



3. Verification:

- Verify that audit logs are being generated by checking the logs of the ArgoCD server pod:

```
kubectl logs -n argocd cargocd-server-pod-names

```
- Look for audit log entries indicating changes made in ArgocD.
